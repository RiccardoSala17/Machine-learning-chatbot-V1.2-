MACHINE LEARNING CHATBOT- texts in ENGLISH - comments in ITA/ENG

My most ambitious project so far. Python based chatbot trained with a piece of the "Cornell movie dataset" through Keras/Tensorflow algorithms.

I uploaded .py's for every separate section of the code,

prova_finale.py is the unified and final runnable version, provided with multilingual comments.
